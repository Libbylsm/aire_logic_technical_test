### This is Liberty Matheson's Aire logic technical test - Medi Score Calculation

* I have tried to ensure the comments are clear for you to understand the code. If you have any further questions about it, feel free to ask me.
* For the CBG bonus task, I completed the code assuming score 2 CBG (2 hours after eating)	is 4.6 - 5.8. I hope this is correct.
